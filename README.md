# @finstocks/core

The shared core of FinStocks — the nexus of the two apps. Pure TypeScript: domain types,
market/trading/strategy maths, static data, query keys, endpoint definitions, and the generated
design tokens. No React, React Native, DOM, `fetch`, or storage imports (lint-enforced).

Consumers: `finstocks-mobile` and `DownStocks/frontend`, which install it as a **git-tag
dependency** for now (`"@finstocks/core": "git+https://github.com/wrk-singha/finstocks-core.git#v0.1.4"`;
the `github:` shorthand makes Yarn 1 fall back to SSH), moving to a
registry after the org transfer. Import paths: `@finstocks/core`, `@finstocks/core/tokens`,
`@finstocks/core/tokens.css`.

## Layout

- `src/` — the package. `src/tokens/` is **generated**; never hand-edit.
- `src/format/` — number formatting (Indian grouping, ₹, %, Cr/L/K). Tests run on Node directly
  (`node --test`, type stripping): test files import `../x.ts` with the extension, and the code
  uses only erasable syntax (no enums, no namespaces, no parameter properties — `tsc` enforces it).
- `tokens/src/*.json` — the design-token source (colour light/dark, type, space, motion).
- `tokens/scripts/build.mjs` — generates `src/tokens/index.ts` and `tokens/dist/tokens.css`.
- `tokens/test/` — WCAG contrast assertions (with a dated allowlist → decision H8).

## Commands

```bash
npm ci
npm run check         # tokens:check + typecheck + prettier --check + tests
npm run tokens:build  # after editing tokens/src/*.json — commit the outputs
```

Package manager: **npm** on purpose — this package is installed from git by consumers on Yarn 4,
npm and pnpm, and Yarn packs a git dependency with the dependency's own package manager; npm is the
one every consumer already has.

## No install-time scripts

This package is installed from git by its consumers, and pnpm runs a git dependency's `prepare`
script as a build step. So: **no `prepare`/`postinstall` here, ever** — formatting is checked in CI,
not by a pre-commit hook.

## Releasing

Bump `version`, commit, tag `vX.Y.Z`, push with tags. Consumers pin the tag.
Rules and extraction plan: the migration docs (`wrk-singha/finstocks-migration`, `SHARED-CORE.md`).

## Versions

- **v0.1.4** — `format/number` (formatNumber, formatCurrency, formatPercent, formatQuantity,
  formatCompactInr, formatCroreCompact, withSign). Font families renamed to the TTFs' PostScript
  names (`SpaceGrotesk-Regular` …): iOS resolves fonts by PostScript name, so the old expo-font
  keys could never have worked in a bare app.
- **v0.1.3** — no install-time scripts; npm as the package manager.
